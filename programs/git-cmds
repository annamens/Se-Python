git clone- clones the project into the local from remote
forking->creates a new repository unlike clone
git fetch- it copies the changes made from remote to local repository but are not reflected in
work directory unless they are merged or rebased
git merge- it is used to merge two branches
git pull- it copies the changes from remote repo to local work space directly unlike git fetch
git pull = git fetch+git merge
Git merge- keeps the commit sequence intact by combining the histories of the two branches into a single branch.
Git rebase-rewrites history by putting changes from one branch at the beginning of another, resulting in a more
organized, linear project history.
git stash- creates a snapshot of the local changes
git stash pop- changes which are in snapshot are applied to the working directory after git stash and git pull.
git reset- rewinds project history to particular point
git reset HEAD~1
git revert-command used to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit
git revert HEAD~1
